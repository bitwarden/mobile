/**
 * An injectable service that produces an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * Angular component or directive.
 * Provided by the `BrowserAnimationsModule` or `NoopAnimationsModule`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * To use this service, add it to your component or directive as a dependency.
 * The service is instantiated along with your component.
 *
 * Apps do not typically need to create their own animation players, but if you
 * do need to, follow these steps:
 *
 * 1. Use the `build()` method to create a programmatic animation using the
 * `animate()` function. The method returns an `AnimationFactory` instance.
 *
 * 2. Use the factory object to create an `AnimationPlayer` and attach it to a DOM element.
 *
 * 3. Use the player object to control the animation programmatically.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // import the service from BrowserAnimationsModule
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '@angular/animations';
 * // require the service as a dependency
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first define a reusable animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // use the returned factory object to create a player
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Creates a named animation trigger, containing a  list of `state()`
 * and `transition()` entries to be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * @param name An identifying string.
 * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of `state()`
 * and `transition()` declarations.
 *
 * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.
 * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that
 * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:
 *
 * `[@triggerName]="expression"`
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the
 * previous and current values against any linked transitions.
 * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided
 * name value.
 * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and
 * transition declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: "my-component",
 *   templateUrl: "my-component-tpl.html",
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger
 * by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using an inline function
 * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide
 * if its associated animation should be run.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.
 * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:
 string]: any}): boolean {
 *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here
 *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';
 * }
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [
 *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [
 *         // the animation sequence code
 *       ]),
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "yes-please-animate";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations
 * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents
 * all animations from rendering.
 * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable
 * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers
 * within the element.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,
 * along with any inner animations.
 *
 * ### Disable animations application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,
 * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.
 * This means that you can disable all animations for an app
 * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';
 *
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`
 * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate
 * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is
 * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.
 *
 * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled
 * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation
 * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides
 * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,
 * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.
 *

/**
 * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.
 *
 * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.
 * A string in the format "duration [delay] [easing]".
 *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,
 * such as "1s" or "10ms" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.
 * The default unit is milliseconds.
 *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates
 * during its runtime. Value is one of  `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`,
 * `ease-in-out`, or a `cubic-bezier()` function call.
 * If not supplied, no easing is applied.
 *
 * For example, the string "1s 100ms ease-out" specifies a duration of
 * 1000 milliseconds, and delay of 100 ms, and the "ease-out" easing style,
 * which decelerates near the end of the duration.
 * @param styles Sets AnimationStyles for the parent animation.
 * A function call to either `style()` or `keyframes()`
 * that returns a collection of CSS style entries to be applied to the parent animation.
 * When null, uses the styles from the destination state.
 * This is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation;
 * see "Animating to the final state" in `transitions()`.
 * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation step.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Call within an animation `sequence()`, `{@link animations/group group()}`, or
 * `transition()` call to specify an animation step
 * that applies given style data to the parent animation for a given amount of time.
 *
 * ### Syntax Examples
 * **Timing examples**
 *
 * The following examples show various `timings` specifications.
 * - `animate(500)` : Duration is 500 milliseconds.
 * - `animate("1s")` : Duration is 1000 milliseconds.
 * - `animate("100ms 0.5s")` : Duration is 100 milliseconds, delay is 500 milliseconds.
 * - `animate("5s ease-in")` : Duration is 5000 milliseconds, easing in.
 * - `animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)")` : Duration is 5000 milliseconds, delay is 10
 * milliseconds, easing according to a bezier curve.
 *
 * **Style examples**
 *
 * The following example calls `style()` to set a single CSS style.
 * ```typescript
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * ```
 * The following example calls `keyframes()` to set a CSS style
 * to different values for successive keyframes.
 * ```typescript
 * animate(500, keyframes(
 *  [
 *   style({ background: "blue" }),
 *   style({ background: "red" })
 *  ])

 * ### Usage
 *

/**
 * Declares an animation transition as a sequence of animation steps to run when a given
 * condition is satisfied. The condition is a Boolean expression or function that compares
 * the previous and current animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur.
 * When the state criteria of a defined transition are met, the associated animation is
 * triggered.
 *
 * @param stateChangeExpr A Boolean expression or function that compares the previous and current
 * animation states, and returns true if this transition should occur. Note that  "true" and "false"
 * match 1 and 0, respectively. An expression is evaluated each time a state change occurs in the
 * animation trigger element.
 * The animation steps run when the expression evaluates to true.
 *
 * - A state-change string takes the form "state1 => state2", where each side is a defined animation
 * state, or an asterix (*) to refer to a dynamic start or end state.
 *   - The expression string can contain multiple comma-separated statements;
 * for example "state1 => state2, state3 => state4".
 *   - Special values `:enter` and `:leave` initiate a transition on the entry and exit states,
 * equivalent to  "void => *"  and "* => void".
 *   - Special values `:increment` and `:decrement` initiate a transition when a numeric value has
 * increased or decreased in value.
 * - A function is executed each time a state change occurs in the animation trigger element.
 * The animation steps run when the function returns true.
 *
 * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()` or
 * `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.
 * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.
 * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the animation,
 * and additional developer-defined parameters. Provided values for additional parameters are used
 * as defaults, and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.
 * @returns An object that encapsulates the transition data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * The template associated with a component binds an animation trigger to an element.
 *
 * ```HTML
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * All transitions are defined within an animation trigger,
 * along with named states that the transitions change to and from.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *  // define states
 *  state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *  state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *  ...]
 * ```
 *
 * Note that when you call the `sequence()` function within a `{@link animations/group group()}`
 * or a `transition()` call, execution does not continue to the next instruction
 * until each of the inner animation steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Syntax examples
 *
 * The following examples define transitions between the two defined states (and default states),
 * using various options:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Transition occurs when the state value
 * // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 * transition("on => off", animate(500))
 * // Run the same animation for both directions
 * transition("on <=> off", animate(500))
 * // Define multiple state-change pairs separated by commas
 * transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special values for state-change expressions
 *
 * - Catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into the page and the
 * destination state is unknown:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition("void => *", [
 *  style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *  animate(500)
 *  ])
 * ```
 *
 * - Capture a state change between any states:
 *
 *  `transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s"))`
 *
 * - Entry and exit transitions:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *   ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *   ])
 * ```
 *
 * - Use `:increment` and `:decrement` to initiate transitions:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition(":increment", group([
 *  query(':enter', [
 *     style({ left: '100%' }),
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))
 *   ]),
 *  query(':leave', [
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))
 *  ])
 * ]))
 *
 * transition(":decrement", group([
 *  query(':enter', [
 *     style({ left: '100%' }),
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))
 *   ]),
 *  query(':leave', [
 *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))
 *  ])
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * ### State-change functions
 *
 * Here is an example of a `fromState` specified as a state-change function that invokes an
 * animation when true:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition((fromState, toState) =>
 *  {
 *   return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *  },
 *  animate("1s 0s"))
 * ```
 *
 * ### Animating to the final state
 *
 * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value
 * with no style data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,
 * for the element to reach the final state. Angular automatically adds or removes
 * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.
 *
 * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,
 * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 *  ])
 * ```
 * ### Boolean value matching
 * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression
 * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```

 * @return An object that encapsulates the child animation data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Each time an animation is triggered in Angular, the parent animation
 * has priority and any child animations are blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations, and run them using this function.
 *
 * Note that this feature is designed to be used with `query()` and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation library. CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API.

/**
 * Finds one or more inner elements within the current element that is

 *
 * @param selector The element to query, or a set of elements that contain Angular-specific
 * characteristics, specified with one or more of the following tokens.
 *  - `query(":enter")` or `query(":leave")` : Query for newly inserted/removed elements.
 *  - `query(":animating")` : Query all currently animating elements.
 *  - `query("@triggerName")` : Query elements that contain an animation trigger.
 *  - `query("@*")` : Query all elements that contain an animation triggers.
 *  - `query(":self")` : Include the current element into the animation sequence.
 *
 * @param animation One or more animation steps to apply to the queried element or elements.
 * An array is treated as an animation sequence.
 * @param options An options object. Use the 'limit' field to limit the total number of
 * items to collect.
 * @return An object that encapsulates the query data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Tokens can be merged into a combined query selector string. For example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, @subTrigger', [...])
 * ```
 *
 * The `query()` function collects multiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. Use the `limit` field of an options object to limit
 * the total number of items to be collected. For example:
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * By default, throws an error when zero items are found. Set the
 * `optional` flag to ignore this error. For example:
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * The following example queries for inner elements and animates them
 * individually using `animate()`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah
 *       </div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *    trigger('queryAnimation', [
 *      transition('* => goAnimate', [
 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 }))),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 }))),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]
 * })
 * class Cmp {
 *   exp = '';
 *
 *   goAnimate() {
 *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

    return { type: 11 /* Query */, selector, animation, options };

/**
 * Use within an animation `query()` call to issue a timing gap after
 * each queried item is animated.
 *
 * @param timings A delay value.
 * @param animation One ore more animation steps.
 * @returns An object that encapsulates the stagger data.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * In the following example, a container element wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an `ngFor`. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * Each time items are added, the opacity fade-in animation runs,
 * and each removed item is faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur, the stagger effect is
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Here is the component code:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '@angular/animations';
 * @Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *     ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *    }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * Here is the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])

 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```

/*
 * [Validation]
 * The visitor code below will traverse the animation AST generated by the animation verb functions
 * (the output is a tree of objects) and attempt to perform a series of validations on the data. The
 * following corner-cases will be validated:
 *
 * 1. Overlap of animations
 * Given that a CSS property cannot be animated in more than one place at the same time, it's
 * important that this behavior is detected and validated. The way in which this occurs is that
 * each time a style property is examined, a string-map containing the property will be updated with
 * the start and end times for when the property is used within an animation step.
 *
 * If there are two or more parallel animations that are currently running (these are invoked by the
 * group()) on the same element then the validator will throw an error. Since the start/end timing
 * values are collected for each property then if the current animation step is animating the same
 * property and its timing values fall anywhere into the window of time that the property is
 * currently being animated within then this is what causes an error.
 *
 * 2. Timing values
 * The validator will validate to see if a timing value of `duration delay easing` or
 * `durationNumber` is valid or not.
 *
 * (note that upon validation the code below will replace the timing data with an object containing
 * {duration,delay,easing}.
 *
 * 3. Offset Validation
 * Each of the style() calls are allowed to have an offset value when placed inside of keyframes().
 * Offsets within keyframes() are considered valid when:
 *
 *   - No offsets are used at all
 *   - Each style() entry contains an offset value
 *   - Each offset is between 0 and 1
 *   - Each offset is greater to or equal than the previous one
 *
 * Otherwise an error will be thrown.

/*
 * The code within this file aims to generate web-animations-compatible keyframes from Angular's
 * animation DSL code.
 *
 * The code below will be converted from:
 *
 * ```
 * sequence([
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(1000, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * To:
 * ```
 * keyframes = [{ opacity: 0, offset: 0 }, { opacity: 1, offset: 1 }]
 * duration = 1000
 * delay = 0
 * easing = ''
 * ```
 *
 * For this operation to cover the combination of animation verbs (style, animate, group, etc...) a
 * combination of prototypical inheritance, AST traversal and merge-sort-like algorithms are used.
 *
 * [AST Traversal]
 * Each of the animation verbs, when executed, will return an string-map object representing what
 * type of action it is (style, animate, group, etc...) and the data associated with it. This means
 * that when functional composition mix of these functions is evaluated (like in the example above)
 * then it will end up producing a tree of objects representing the animation itself.
 *
 * When this animation object tree is processed by the visitor code below it will visit each of the
 * verb statements within the visitor. And during each visit it will build the context of the
 * animation keyframes by interacting with the `TimelineBuilder`.
 *
 * [TimelineBuilder]
 * This class is responsible for tracking the styles and building a series of keyframe objects for a
 * timeline between a start and end time. The builder starts off with an initial timeline and each
 * time the AST comes across a `group()`, `keyframes()` or a combination of the two wihtin a
 * `sequence()` then it will generate a sub timeline for each step as well as a new one after
 * they are complete.
 *
 * As the AST is traversed, the timing state on each of the timelines will be incremented. If a sub
 * timeline was created (based on one of the cases above) then the parent timeline will attempt to
 * merge the styles used within the sub timelines into itself (only with group() this will happen).
 * This happens with a merge operation (much like how the merge works in mergesort) and it will only
 * copy the most recently used styles from the sub timelines into the parent timeline. This ensures
 * that if the styles are used later on in another phase of the animation then they will be the most
 * up-to-date values.
 *
 * [How Missing Styles Are Updated]
 * Each timeline has a `backFill` property which is responsible for filling in new styles into
 * already processed keyframes if a new style shows up later within the animation sequence.
 *
 * ```
 * sequence([
 *   style({ width: 0 }),
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 100 })),
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 200 })),
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 300 }))
 *   animate(1000, style({ width: 400, height: 400 })) // notice how `height` doesn't exist anywhere
 * else
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * What is happening here is that the `height` value is added later in the sequence, but is missing
 * from all previous animation steps. Therefore when a keyframe is created it would also be missing
 * from all previous keyframes up until where it is first used. For the timeline keyframe generation
 * to properly fill in the style it will place the previous value (the value from the parent
 * timeline) or a default value of `*` into the backFill object. Given that each of the keyframe
 * styles are objects that prototypically inhert from the backFill object, this means that if a
 * value is added into the backFill then it will automatically propagate any missing values to all
 * keyframes. Therefore the missing `height` value will be properly filled into the already
 * processed keyframes.
 *
 * When a sub-timeline is created it will have its own backFill property. This is done so that
 * styles present within the sub-timeline do not accidentally seep into the previous/future timeline
 * keyframes
 *
 * (For prototypically-inherited contents to be detected a `for(i in obj)` loop must be used.)
 *
 * [Validation]
 * The code in this file is not responsible for validation. That functionality happens with within
 * the `AnimationValidatorVisitor` code.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * A service that applications can use to interact with a browser's URL.
 *
 * Depending on the `LocationStrategy` used, `Location` persists
 * to the URL's path or the URL's hash segment.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * It's better to use the `Router#navigate` service to trigger route changes. Use
 * `Location` only if you need to interact with or create normalized URLs outside of
 * routing.
 *
 * `Location` is responsible for normalizing the URL against the application's base href.
 * A normalized URL is absolute from the URL host, includes the application's base href, and has no
 * trailing slash:
 * - `/my/app/user/123` is normalized
 * - `my/app/user/123` **is not** normalized
 * - `/my/app/user/123/` **is not** normalized
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * <code-example path='common/location/ts/path_location_component.ts'
 * region='LocationComponent'></code-example>

 * Instantiates a single {@link Component} type and inserts its Host View into current View.
 * `NgComponentOutlet` provides a declarative approach for dynamic component creation.
 *
 * `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and
 * any existing component will get destroyed.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Fine tune control
 *
 * You can control the component creation process by using the following optional attributes:
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletInjector`: Optional custom {@link Injector} that will be used as parent for
 * the Component. Defaults to the injector of the current view container.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletContent`: Optional list of projectable nodes to insert into the content
 * section of the component, if exists.
 *
 * * `ngComponentOutletNgModuleFactory`: Optional module factory to allow dynamically loading other
 * module, then load a component from that module.
 *
 * ### Syntax
 *
 * Simple
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression"></ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized injector/content
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   injector: injectorExpression;
 *                                   content: contentNodesExpression;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * Customized ngModuleFactory
 * ```
 * <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet="componentTypeExpression;
 *                                   ngModuleFactory: moduleFactory;">
 * </ng-container>
 * ```
 *
 * ### A simple example

/**
 * A [structural directive](guide/structural-directives) that renders
 * a template for each item in a collection.
 * The directive is placed on an element, which becomes the parent
 * of the cloned templates.
 *
 * The `ngForOf` directive is generally used in the
 * [shorthand form](guide/structural-directives#asterisk) `*ngFor`.
 * In this form, the template to be rendered for each iteration is the content
 * of an anchor element containing the directive.
 *
 * The following example shows the shorthand syntax with some options,
 * contained in an `<li>` element.
 *
 * ```
 * <li *ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn">...</li>
 * ```
 *
 * The shorthand form expands into a long form that uses the `ngForOf` selector
 * on an `<ng-template>` element.
 * The content of the `<ng-template>` element is the `<li>` element that held the
 * short-form directive.
 *
 * Here is the expanded version of the short-form example.
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]="items" let-i="index" [ngForTrackBy]="trackByFn">
 *   <li>...</li>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Angular automatically expands the shorthand syntax as it compiles the template.
 * The context for each embedded view is logically merged to the current component
 * context according to its lexical position.
 *
 * When using the shorthand syntax, Angular allows only [one structural directive
 * on an element](guide/built-in-directives#one-per-element).
 * If you want to iterate conditionally, for example,
 * put the `*ngIf` on a container element that wraps the `*ngFor` element.
 * For futher discussion, see
 * [Structural Directives](guide/built-in-directives#one-per-element).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Local variables
 *
 * `NgForOf` provides exported values that can be aliased to local variables.
 * For example:
 *
 *  ```
 * <li *ngFor="let user of users; index as i; first as isFirst">
 *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf="isFirst">default</span>
 * </li>
 * ```
 *
 * The following exported values can be aliased to local variables:
 *
 * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).
 * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is
 * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |
 * async`).
 * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.
 * - `count: number`: The length of the iterable.
 * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.
 * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.
 * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.
 * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.
 *
 * ### Change propagation
 *
 * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce
 * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful
 * controls that are present, such as `<input>` elements that accept user input. Inserted rows can
 * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state
 * such as user input.
 * For more on animations, see [Transitions and Triggers](guide/transition-and-triggers).
 *
 * The identities of elements in the iterator can change while the data does not.
 * This can happen, for example, if the iterator is produced from an RPC to the server, and that
 * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response produces objects with
 * different identities, and Angular must tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old
 * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).
 *
 * To avoid this expensive operation, you can customize the default tracking algorithm.
 * by supplying the `trackBy` option to `NgForOf`.
 * `trackBy` takes a function that has two arguments: `index` and `item`.
 * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.
 *

/**
 * A structural directive that conditionally includes a template based on the value of
 * an expression coerced to Boolean.
 * When the expression evaluates to true, Angular renders the template
 * provided in a `then` clause, and when  false or null,
 * Angular renders the template provided in an optional `else` clause. The default
 * template for the `else` clause is blank.
 *
 * A [shorthand form](guide/structural-directives#asterisk) of the directive,
 * `*ngIf="condition"`, is generally used, provided
 * as an attribute of the anchor element for the inserted template.
 * Angular expands this into a more explicit version, in which the anchor element
 * is contained in an `<ng-template>` element.
 *
 * Simple form with shorthand syntax:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
 * ```
 *
 * Simple form with expanded syntax:
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template [ngIf]="condition"><div>Content to render when condition is
 * true.</div></ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with an "else" block:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition; else elseBlock">Content to render when condition is true.</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>

 *

 * <div *ngIf="condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock"></div>
 * <ng-template #thenBlock>Content to render when condition is true.</ng-template>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when condition is false.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * Form with storing the value locally:
 *
 * ```
 * <div *ngIf="condition as value; else elseBlock">{{value}}</div>
 * <ng-template #elseBlock>Content to render when value is null.</ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The `*ngIf` directive is most commonly used to conditionally show an inline template,
 * as seen in the following  example.
 * The default `else` template is blank.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}
 *
 * ### Showing an alternative template using `else`
 *
 * To display a template when `expression` evaluates to false, use an `else` template
 * binding as shown in the following example.
 * The `else` binding points to an `<ng-template>`  element labeled `#elseBlock`.
 * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view, but is typically placed right after
 * `ngIf` for readability.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}
 *
 * ### Using an external `then` template
 *
 * In the previous example, the then-clause template is specified inline, as the content of the
 * tag that contains the `ngIf` directive. You can also specify a template that is defined
 * externally, by referencing a labeled `<ng-template>` element. When you do this, you can
 * change which template to use at runtime, as shown in the following example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}
 *
 * ### Storing a conditional result in a variable
 *
 * You might want to show a set of properties from the same object. If you are waiting
 * for asynchronous data, the object can be undefined.
 * In this case, you can use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local
 * variable as shown in the following example.
 *
 * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}
 *
 * This code uses only one `AsyncPipe`, so only one subscription is created.
 * The conditional statement stores the result of `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.
 * You can then bind the local `user` repeatedly.
 *
 * The conditional displays the data only if `userStream` returns a value,
 * so you don't need to use the
 * safe-navigation-operator (`?.`)
 * to guard against null values when accessing properties.
 * You can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.
 *
 * ### Shorthand syntax
 *
 * The shorthand syntax `*ngIf` expands into two separate template specifications
 * for the "then" and "else" clauses. For example, consider the following shorthand statement,
 * that is meant to show a loading page while waiting for data to be loaded.
 *
 * ```
 * <div class="hero-list" *ngIf="heroes else loading">
 *  ...
 * </div>
 *
 * <ng-template #loading>
 *  <div>Loading...</div>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * You can see that the "else" clause references the `<ng-template>`
 * with the `#loading` label, and the template for the "then" clause
 * is provided as the content of the anchor element.
 *
 * However, when Angular expands the shorthand syntax, it creates
 * another `<ng-template>` tag, with `ngIf` and `ngIfElse` directives.
 * The anchor element containing the template for the "then" clause becomes
 * the content of this unlabeled `<ng-template>` tag.
 *
 * ```
 * <ng-template [ngIf]="heroes" [ngIfElse]="loading">
 *  <div class="hero-list">
 *   ...
 *  </div>
 * </ng-template>
 *
 * <ng-template #loading>
 *  <div>Loading...</div>
 * </ng-template>
 * ```
 *
 * The presence of the implicit template object has implications for the nesting of
 * structural directives. For more on this subject, see
 * [Structural Directives](https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives#one-per-element).

/**
 * @ngModule CommonModule
 *
 * @description
 * The `[ngSwitch]` directive on a container specifies an expression to match against.
 * The expressions to match are provided by `ngSwitchCase` directives on views within the container.
 * - Every view that matches is rendered.
 * - If there are no matches, a view with the `ngSwitchDefault` directive is rendered.
 * - Elements within the `[NgSwitch]` statement but outside of any `NgSwitchCase`
 * or `ngSwitchDefault` directive are preserved at the location.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * Define a container element for the directive, and specify the switch expression
 * to match against as an attribute:
 *
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 * ```
 *
 * Within the container, `*ngSwitchCase` statements specify the match expressions
 * as attributes. Include `*ngSwitchDefault` as the final case.
 *
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 *    <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_1">...</some-element>
 * ...
 *    <some-element *ngSwitchDefault>...</some-element>
 * </container-element>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage Examples
 *
 * The following example shows how to use more than one case to display the same view:
 *
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 *   <!-- the same view can be shown in more than one case -->
 *   <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_1">...</some-element>
 *   <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_2">...</some-element>
 *   <some-other-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_3">...</some-other-element>
 *   <!--default case when there are no matches -->
 *   <some-element *ngSwitchDefault>...</some-element>
 * </container-element>
 * ```
 *
 * The following example shows how cases can be nested:
 * ```
 * <container-element [ngSwitch]="switch_expression">
 *       <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_1">...</some-element>
 *       <some-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_2">...</some-element>
 *       <some-other-element *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_3">...</some-other-element>
 *       <ng-container *ngSwitchCase="match_expression_3">
 *         <!-- use a ng-container to group multiple root nodes -->
 *         <inner-element></inner-element>
 *         <inner-other-element></inner-other-element>
 *       </ng-container>
 *       <some-element *ngSwitchDefault>...</some-element>
 *     </container-element>

 * Unwraps a value from an asynchronous primitive.
 *
 * The `async` pipe subscribes to an `Observable` or `Promise` and returns the latest value it has
 * emitted. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for
 * changes. When the component gets destroyed, the `async` pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid
 * potential memory leaks.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Examples
 *
 * This example binds a `Promise` to the view. Clicking the `Resolve` button resolves the
 * promise.
 *
 * {@example common/pipes/ts/async_pipe.ts region='AsyncPipePromise'}
 *
 * It's also possible to use `async` with Observables. The example below binds the `time` Observable
 * to the view. The Observable continuously updates the view with the current time.

/**
 * @ngModule CommonModule
 * @description
 *
 * Formats a date value according to locale rules.
 *
 * Only the `en-US` locale data comes with Angular. To localize dates
 * in another language, you must import the corresponding locale data.
 * See the [I18n guide](guide/i18n#i18n-pipes) for more information.
 *
 * @see `formatDate()`
 *
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The result of this pipe is not reevaluated when the input is mutated. To avoid the need to
 * reformat the date on every change-detection cycle, treat the date as an immutable object
 * and change the reference when the pipe needs to run again.
 *
 * ### Pre-defined format options

 * ### Format examples
 *
 * These examples transform a date into various formats,
 * assuming that `dateObj` is a JavaScript `Date` object for
 * year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11,
 * given in the local time for the `en-US` locale.
 *
 * ```
 * {{ dateObj | date }}               // output is 'Jun 15, 2015'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'medium' }}      // output is 'Jun 15, 2015, 9:43:11 PM'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'shortTime' }}   // output is '9:43 PM'
 * {{ dateObj | date:'mm:ss' }}       // output is '43:11'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Usage example
 *
 * The following component uses a date pipe to display the current date in different formats.
 *
 * ```
 * @Component({
 *  selector: 'date-pipe',
 *  template: `<div>
 *    <p>Today is {{today | date}}</p>
 *    <p>Or if you prefer, {{today | date:'fullDate'}}</p>
 *    <p>The time is {{today | date:'h:mm a z'}}</p>

 *
 * @see `formatNumber()`
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### digitsInfo
 *
 * The value's decimal representation is specified by the `digitsInfo`
 * parameter, written in the following format:<br>
 *
 * ```
 * {minIntegerDigits}.{minFractionDigits}-{maxFractionDigits}
 * ```
 *
 *  - `minIntegerDigits`:
 * The minimum number of integer digits before the decimal point.
 * Default is 1.
 *
 * - `minFractionDigits`:
 * The minimum number of digits after the decimal point.
 * Default is 0.
 *
 *  - `maxFractionDigits`:
 * The maximum number of digits after the decimal point.
 * Default is 3.
 *
 * If the formatted value is truncated it will be rounded using the "to-nearest" method:
 *
 * ```
 * {{3.6 | number: '1.0-0'}}
 * <!--will output '4'-->
 *
 * {{-3.6 | number:'1.0-0'}}
 * <!--will output '-4'-->
 * ```
 *
 * ### locale
 *
 * `locale` will format a value according to locale rules.
 * Locale determines group sizing and separator,
 * decimal point character, and other locale-specific configurations.
 *
 * When not supplied, uses the value of `LOCALE_ID`, which is `en-US` by default.
 *
 * See [Setting your app locale](guide/i18n#setting-up-the-locale-of-your-app).

 * To solve that, it is required to track the state of the execution of these init hooks.
 * This is done by storing and maintaining flags in the view: the {@link InitPhaseState},
 * and the index within that phase. They can be seen as a cursor in the following structure:
 * [[onInit1, onInit2], [afterContentInit1], [afterViewInit1, afterViewInit2, afterViewInit3]]
 * They are are stored as flags in LView[FLAGS].
 *
 * 2. Pre-order hooks can be executed in batches, because of the select instruction.
 * To be able to pause and resume their execution, we also need some state about the hook's array
 * that is being processed:
 * - the index of the next hook to be executed
 * - the number of init hooks already found in the processed part of the  array
 * They are are stored as flags in LView[PREORDER_HOOK_FLAGS].

/**
 * Creates a token that can be used in a DI Provider.
 *
 * Use an `InjectionToken` whenever the type you are injecting is not reified (does not have a
 * runtime representation) such as when injecting an interface, callable type, array or
 * parameterized type.
 *
 * `InjectionToken` is parameterized on `T` which is the type of object which will be returned by
 * the `Injector`. This provides additional level of type safety.
 *
 * ```
 * interface MyInterface {...}
 * var myInterface = injector.get(new InjectionToken<MyInterface>('SomeToken'));
 * // myInterface is inferred to be MyInterface.
 * ```
 *
 * When creating an `InjectionToken`, you can optionally specify a factory function which returns
 * (possibly by creating) a default value of the parameterized type `T`. This sets up the
 * `InjectionToken` using this factory as a provider as if it was defined explicitly in the
 * application's root injector. If the factory function, which takes zero arguments, needs to inject
 * dependencies, it can do so using the `inject` function. See below for an example.
 *
 * Additionally, if a `factory` is specified you can also specify the `providedIn` option, which
 * overrides the above behavior and marks the token as belonging to a particular `@NgModule`. As
 * mentioned above, `'root'` is the default value for `providedIn`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Basic Example
 *
 * ### Plain InjectionToken
 *
 * {@example core/di/ts/injector_spec.ts region='InjectionToken'}
 *
 * ### Tree-shakable InjectionToken

 * Soy's EscapingConventions):
 * (1) Either an allowed protocol (http, https, mailto or ftp).
 * (2) or no protocol.  A protocol must be followed by a colon. The below

 *     A colon after a hash (#) must be in the fragment.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a (?) must be in a query.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a single solidus (/) must be in a path.
 *     Otherwise, a colon after a double solidus (//) must be in the authority
 *     (before port).
 *
 * The pattern disallows &, used in HTML entity declarations before
 * one of the characters in [/?#]. This disallows HTML entities used in the
 * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. "h&#116;tp" for "http".
 * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,
 * e.g. "foo&lt;bar/baz".  Our existing escaping functions should not produce

 * Consider: `<!-- The way you close a comment is with ">", and "->" at the beginning or by "-->" or
 * "--!>" at the end. -->`. Above the `"-->"` is meant to be text not an end to the comment. This
 * can be created programmatically through DOM APIs. (`<!--` are also disallowed.)
 *
 * see: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#comments
 *
 * ```
 * div.innerHTML = div.innerHTML
 * ```
 *
 * One would expect that the above code would be safe to do, but it turns out that because comment
 * text is not escaped, the comment may contain text which will prematurely close the comment
 * opening up the application for XSS attack. (In SSR we programmatically create comment nodes which
 * may contain such text and expect them to be safe.)
 *
 * This function escapes the comment text by looking for comment delimiters (`<` and `>`) and
 * surrounding them with `_>_` where the `_` is a zero width space `\u200B`. The result is that if a
 * comment contains any of the comment start/end delimiters (such as `<!--`, `-->` or `--!>`) the
 * text it will render normally but it will not cause the HTML parser to close/open the comment.
 *
 * @param value text to make safe for comment node by escaping the comment open/close character

/**
 * A ReflectiveDependency injection container used for instantiating objects and resolving
 * dependencies.
 *
 * An `Injector` is a replacement for a `new` operator, which can automatically resolve the
 * constructor dependencies.
 *
 * In typical use, application code asks for the dependencies in the constructor and they are
 * resolved by the `Injector`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * The following example creates an `Injector` configured to create `Engine` and `Car`.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * @Injectable()
 * class Engine {
 * }
 *
 * @Injectable()
 * class Car {
 *   constructor(public engine:Engine) {}
 * }
 *
 * var injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([Car, Engine]);
 * var car = injector.get(Car);
 * expect(car instanceof Car).toBe(true);
 * expect(car.engine instanceof Engine).toBe(true);
 * ```
 *
 * Notice, we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
 * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.
 *
 * @deprecated from v5 - slow and brings in a lot of code, Use `Injector.create` instead.
 * @publicApi

/**
 * NOTE: The word `styling` is used interchangeably as style or class styling.
 *
 * This file contains code to link styling instructions together so that they can be replayed in
 * priority order. The file exists because Ivy styling instruction execution order does not match
 * that of the priority order. The purpose of this code is to create a linked list so that the
 * instructions can be traversed in priority order when computing the styles.
 *
 * Assume we are dealing with the following code:
 * ```
 * @Component({
 *   template: `
 *     <my-cmp [style]=" {color: '#001'} "
 *             [style.color]=" #002 "
 *             dir-style-color-1
 *             dir-style-color-2> `
 * })
 * class ExampleComponent {
 *   static ngComp = ... {
 *     ...
 *     // Compiler ensures that `ɵɵstyleProp` is after `ɵɵstyleMap`
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#001'});
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#002');
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: `[dir-style-color-1]',
 * })
 * class Style1Directive {
 *   @HostBinding('style') style = {color: '#005'};
 *   @HostBinding('style.color') color = '#006';
 *
 *   static ngDir = ... {
 *     ...
 *     // Compiler ensures that `ɵɵstyleProp` is after `ɵɵstyleMap`
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#005'});
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#006');
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: `[dir-style-color-2]',
 * })
 * class Style2Directive {
 *   @HostBinding('style') style = {color: '#007'};
 *   @HostBinding('style.color') color = '#008';
 *
 *   static ngDir = ... {
 *     ...
 *     // Compiler ensures that `ɵɵstyleProp` is after `ɵɵstyleMap`
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#007'});
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#008');
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: `my-cmp',
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   @HostBinding('style') style = {color: '#003'};
 *   @HostBinding('style.color') color = '#004';
 *
 *   static ngComp = ... {
 *     ...
 *     // Compiler ensures that `ɵɵstyleProp` is after `ɵɵstyleMap`
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#003'});
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#004');
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The Order of instruction execution is:
 *
 * NOTE: the comment binding location is for illustrative purposes only.
 *
 * ```
 * // Template: (ExampleComponent)
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#001'});   // Binding index: 10
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#002');  // Binding index: 12
 * // MyComponent
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#003'});   // Binding index: 20
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#004');  // Binding index: 22
 * // Style1Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#005'});   // Binding index: 24
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#006');  // Binding index: 26
 * // Style2Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#007'});   // Binding index: 28
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#008');  // Binding index: 30
 * ```
 *
 * The correct priority order of concatenation is:
 *
 * ```
 * // MyComponent
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#003'});   // Binding index: 20
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#004');  // Binding index: 22
 * // Style1Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#005'});   // Binding index: 24
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#006');  // Binding index: 26
 * // Style2Directive
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#007'});   // Binding index: 28
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#008');  // Binding index: 30
 * // Template: (ExampleComponent)
 *     ɵɵstyleMap({color: '#001'});   // Binding index: 10
 *     ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#002');  // Binding index: 12
 * ```
 *
 * What color should be rendered?
 *
 * Once the items are correctly sorted in the list, the answer is simply the last item in the
 * concatenation list which is `#002`.
 *
 * To do so we keep a linked list of all of the bindings which pertain to this element.
 * Notice that the bindings are inserted in the order of execution, but the `TView.data` allows
 * us to traverse them in the order of priority.
 *
 * |Idx|`TView.data`|`LView`          | Notes
 * |---|------------|-----------------|--------------
 * |...|            |                 |

 * |20 |`null`      |`{color: '#003'}`| `ɵɵstyleMap('color', {color: '#003'})`
 * |21 |`0 | 22`    | ...             |
 * |22 |`color`     |`'#004'`         | `ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#004')`
 * |23 |`20 | 24`   | ...             |
 * |24 |`null`      |`{color: '#005'}`| `ɵɵstyleMap('color', {color: '#005'})`
 * |25 |`22 | 26`   | ...             |
 * |26 |`color`     |`'#006'`         | `ɵɵstyleProp('color', '#006')`
 * |27 |`24 | 28`   | ...             |
 * |28 |`null`      |`{color: '#007'}`| `ɵɵstyleMap('color', {color: '#007'})`

 * |31 |`28 | 10`   | ...             |
 *
 * The above data structure allows us to re-concatenate the styling no matter which data binding
 * changes.
 *
 * NOTE: in addition to keeping track of next/previous index the `TView.data` also stores prev/next
 * duplicate bit. The duplicate bit if true says there either is a binding with the same name or
 * there is a map (which may contain the name). This information is useful in knowing if other
 * styles with higher priority need to be searched for overwrites.
 *
 * NOTE: See `should support example in 'tnode_linked_list.ts' documentation` in
 * `tnode_linked_list_spec.ts` for working example.

 * Update the `TStylingKey` of the first template instruction in `TNode`.
 *
 * Logically `hostBindings` styling instructions are of lower priority than that of the template.
 * However, they execute after the template styling instructions. This means that they get inserted
 * in front of the template styling instructions.
 *
 * If we have a template styling instruction and a new `hostBindings` styling instruction is
 * executed it means that it may need to steal static fields from the template instruction. This
 * method allows us to update the first template instruction `TStylingKey` with a new value.
 *
 * Assume:
 * ```
 * <div my-dir style="color: red" [style.color]="tmplExp"></div>
 *
 * @Directive({
 *   host: {
 *     'style': 'width: 100px',
 *     '[style.color]': 'dirExp',
 *   }
 * })
 * class MyDir {}
 * ```
 *
 * when `[style.color]="tmplExp"` executes it creates this data structure.
 * ```
 *  ['', 'color', 'color', 'red', 'width', '100px'],
 * ```
 *
 * The reason for this is that the template instruction does not know if there are styling
 * instructions and must assume that there are none and must collect all of the static styling.
 * (both
 * `color' and 'width`)
 *
 * When `'[style.color]': 'dirExp',` executes we need to insert a new data into the linked list.
 * ```
 *  ['', 'color', 'width', '100px'],  // newly inserted
 *  ['', 'color', 'color', 'red', 'width', '100px'], // this is wrong
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that the template statics is now wrong as it incorrectly contains `width` so we need to
 * update it like so:
 * ```
 *  ['', 'color', 'width', '100px'],
 *  ['', 'color', 'color', 'red'],    // UPDATE
 * ```
 *
 * @param tData `TData` where the linked list is stored.

 *    `ɵɵi18nStart` instruction.
 * 2. All `TNodeType.Placeholder` `TNodes` are elements which will be created later by

 * 3. `ɵɵelementStart` instruction will create `TNode`s in the ascending `TNode.index` order. (So a

 *
 * We use the above three invariants to determine `TNode.insertBeforeIndex`.
 *
 * In an ideal world `TNode.insertBeforeIndex` would always be `TNode.next.index`. However,
 * this will not work because `TNode.next.index` may be larger than `TNode.index` which means that
 * the next node is not yet created and therefore we can't insert in front of it.
 *
 * Rule1: `TNode.insertBeforeIndex = null` if `TNode.next === null` (Initial condition, as we don't

 * Rule2: If `previousTNode` is created after the `tNode` being inserted, then

 *
 * The following examples demonstrate how to modify default change-detection behavior
 * to perform explicit detection when needed.
 *
 * ### Use `markForCheck()` with `CheckOnce` strategy
 *
 * The following example sets the `OnPush` change-detection strategy for a component
 * (`CheckOnce`, rather than the default `CheckAlways`), then forces a second check
 * after an interval. See [live demo](https://plnkr.co/edit/GC512b?p=preview).
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts"
 * region="mark-for-check"></code-example>
 *
 * ### Detach change detector to limit how often check occurs
 *
 * The following example defines a component with a large list of read-only data
 * that is expected to change constantly, many times per second.
 * To improve performance, we want to check and update the list
 * less often than the changes actually occur. To do that, we detach
 * the component's change detector and perform an explicit local check every five seconds.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="detach"></code-example>
 *
 *
 * ### Reattaching a detached component
 *
 * The following example creates a component displaying live data.
 * The component detaches its change detector from the main change detector tree
 * when the `live` property is set to false, and reattaches it when the property
 * becomes true.

// This function calls the ngAfterContentCheck, ngAfterContentInit,
// ngAfterViewCheck, and ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hooks (depending on the node
// flags in lifecycle). Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are
// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the
// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a
// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the
// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the
// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending
// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of
// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This
// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an
// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the
// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element
// and D is a directive)
//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index
//    E1        0                6
//      E2      1                1
//       D3     2                0
//      E4      3                5
//       E5     4                4
//        E6    5                2
//        E7    6                3
// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the
// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +
// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit
// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or
// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the
// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have
// lifecycle hooks).
//
// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the
// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to
// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will
// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of
// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and
// pass is complete.
//
// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()
// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(). The expected
// initIndex is set to 6, the recusive checkAndUpdateView() starts walk again.
// D3, E2, E6, E7, E5 and E4 are skipped, ngAfterViewInit() is called on E1.
// When the recursion returns the initIndex will be 7 so E1 is skipped as it
// has already been called in the recursively called checkAnUpdateView().

/**
 * A reference to an Angular application running on a page.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * {@a is-stable-examples}
 * ### isStable examples and caveats
 *
 * Note two important points about `isStable`, demonstrated in the examples below:
 * - the application will never be stable if you start any kind
 * of recurrent asynchronous task when the application starts
 * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`
 * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);
 * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.
 *
 * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task
 * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),
 * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *      filter(stable => stable)
 *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');
 *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,
 * and the trace "App is stable now" will never get logged.
 *
 * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,
 * you have to wait for the application to be stable
 * before starting your polling process.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));
 * }
 * ```
 * In this example, the trace "App is stable now" will be logged
 * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.
 *
 * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,
 * which means that the code in the subscription
 * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.
 *
 * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,
 * you update a field of your component
 * and display it in its template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);
 * }
 * ```
 * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,
 * the `value` field will be updated properly,
 * but the template will not be refreshed!
 *
 * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => {
 *     this.value = counter;
 *     cd.detectChanges();
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.
 *
 * ```
 * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {
 *   appRef.isStable.pipe(
 *     first(stable => stable),
 *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))
 *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));
 * }
 * ```

 *   punctuation symbols).
 * - `local-part` cannot begin or end with a period (`.`).
 * - `local-part` cannot be longer than 64 characters.
 * - `tld` consists of one or more `labels` separated by periods (`.`). For example `localhost` or

 * - A `label` consists of one or more of the allowed characters (alphanumeric, dashes (`-`) and
 *   periods (`.`)).
 * - A `label` cannot begin or end with a dash (`-`) or a period (`.`).
 * - A `label` cannot be longer than 63 characters.
 * - The whole address cannot be longer than 254 characters.
 *
 * ## Implementation background
 *
 * This regexp was ported over from AngularJS (see there for git history):
 * https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/c133ef836/src/ng/directive/input.js#L27
 * It is based on the

 * some enhancements to incorporate more RFC rules (such as rules related to domain names and the
 * lengths of different parts of the address). The main differences from the WHATWG version are:
 *   - Disallow `local-part` to begin or end with a period (`.`).
 *   - Disallow `local-part` length to exceed 64 characters.
 *   - Disallow total address length to exceed 254 characters.

 * See [this commit](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/f3f5cf72e) for more details.

     * appended to the provided string (if not already present), and the resulting regular
     * expression is used to test the values.

/**
 * Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * This is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * `FormGroup` and `FormArray`. It extends the `AbstractControl` class that
 * implements most of the base functionality for accessing the value, validation status,
 * user interactions and events. See [usage examples below](#usage-notes).
 *
 * @see `AbstractControl`
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 * @see [Usage Notes](#usage-notes)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Initializing Form Controls
 *
 * Instantiate a `FormControl`, with an initial value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'some value'
 *```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a form state object. The `value`
 * and `disabled` keys are required in this case.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl({ value: 'n/a', disabled: true });
 * console.log(control.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(control.status);    // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control with a sync validator.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(control.value);      // ''
 * console.log(control.status);     // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * The following example initializes the control using an options object.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a blur event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'blur'` to update on the blur `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configure the control to update on a submit event
 *
 * Set the `updateOn` option to `'submit'` to update on a submit `event`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'submit' });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value
 *
 * You reset to a specific form state by passing through a standalone
 * value or a form state object that contains both a value and a disabled state
 * (these are the only two properties that cannot be calculated).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 *
 * control.reset('Drew');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Reset the control back to an initial value and disabled
 *
 * ```
 * const control = new FormControl('Nancy');
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Nancy'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'VALID'
 *
 * control.reset({ value: 'Drew', disabled: true });
 *
 * console.log(control.value); // 'Drew'
 * console.log(control.status); // 'DISABLED'
 * ```

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of a group of `FormControl` instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the status values
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormArray`.
 *
 * When instantiating a `FormGroup`, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child registers the name for the control.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create a form group with 2 controls
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form group with a group-level validator
 *
 * You include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like `FormControl` instances, you choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, { validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form group
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *   one: new FormControl()
 * }, { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```

/**
 * Tracks the value and validity state of an array of `FormControl`,
 * `FormGroup` or `FormArray` instances.
 *
 * A `FormArray` aggregates the values of each child `FormControl` into an array.
 * It calculates its status by reducing the status values of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with `FormControl` and `FormGroup`.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Create an array of form controls
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * ### Create a form array with array-level validators
 *
 * You include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators are passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form array
 *
 * The options object is used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls from a form array
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, `removeAt` or `clear` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.

/**
 * @description
 * Creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You optionally export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * `FormGroup` instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * gives you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, use `NgModel` with a `name`
 * attribute. You may use `NgModelGroup` to create sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * If necessary, listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event emits the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * To import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, add the `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Listening for form submission
 *
 * The following example shows how to capture the form values from the "ngSubmit" event.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Setting the update options
 *
 * The following example shows you how to change the "updateOn" option from its default using
 * ngFormOptions.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form [ngFormOptions]="{updateOn: 'blur'}">
 *    <input name="one" ngModel>  <!-- this ngModel will update on blur -->
 * </form>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Native DOM validation UI
 *
 * In order to prevent the native DOM form validation UI from interfering with Angular's form
 * validation, Angular automatically adds the `novalidate` attribute on any `<form>` whenever
 * `FormModule` or `ReactiveFormModule` are imported into the application.
 * If you want to explicitly enable native DOM validation UI with Angular forms, you can add the
 * `ngNativeValidate` attribute to the `<form>` element:
 *
 * ```html
 * <form ngNativeValidate>
 *   ...
 * </form>
 * ```

 * This directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional `Input`. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the domain model's value in the component
 * class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-in-a-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to
 * the domain model in your class.
 *
 * To inspect the properties of the associated `FormControl` (like the validity state),
 * export the directive into a local template variable using `ngModel` as the key (ex:
 * `#myVar="ngModel"`). You can then access the control using the directive's `control` property.
 * However, the most commonly used properties (like `valid` and `dirty`) also exist on the control
 * for direct access. See a full list of properties directly available in
 * `AbstractControlDirective`.
 *
 * @see `RadioControlValueAccessor`
 * @see `SelectControlValueAccessor`

 *
 * ### Using ngModel on a standalone control
 *
 * The following examples show a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * In the context of a parent form, it's often unnecessary to include one-way or two-way binding,
 * as the parent form syncs the value for you. You access its properties by exporting it into a
 * local template variable using `ngForm` such as (`#f="ngForm"`). Use the variable where
 * needed on form submission.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * ### Using ngModel within a form
 *
 * The following example shows controls using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Using a standalone ngModel within a group
 *
 * The following example shows you how to use a standalone ngModel control
 * within a form. This controls the display of the form, but doesn't contain form data.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form>
 *   <input name="login" ngModel placeholder="Login">
 *   <input type="checkbox" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{standalone: true}"> Show more options?
 * </form>
 * <!-- form value: {login: ''} -->
 * ```
 *
 * ### Setting the ngModel `name` attribute through options
 *
 * The following example shows you an alternate way to set the name attribute. Here,
 * an attribute identified as name is used within a custom form control component. To still be able
 * to specify the NgModel's name, you must specify it using the `ngModelOptions` input instead.
 *
 * ```html
 * <form>
 *   <my-custom-form-control name="Nancy" ngModel [ngModelOptions]="{name: 'user'}">
 *   </my-custom-form-control>
 * </form>
 * <!-- form value: {user: ''} -->
 * ```

 * @description
 *
 * Syncs a nested `FormGroup` to a DOM element.
 *
 * This directive can only be used with a parent `FormGroupDirective`.
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the nested `FormGroup` to link, and
 * looks for a `FormGroup` registered with that name in the parent
 * `FormGroup` instance you passed into `FormGroupDirective`.
 *
 * Use nested form groups to validate a sub-group of a
 * form separately from the rest or to group the values of certain
 * controls into their own nested object.
 *
 * @see [Reactive Forms Guide](guide/reactive-forms)
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Access the group by name
 *
 * The following example uses the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method to access the
 * associated `FormGroup`
 *
 * ```ts
 *   this.form.get('name');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Access individual controls in the group
 *
 * The following example uses the {@link AbstractControl#get get} method to access
 * individual controls within the group using dot syntax.
 *
 * ```ts
 *   this.form.get('name.first');
 * ```
 *
 * ### Register a nested `FormGroup`.
 *
 * The following example registers a nested *name* `FormGroup` within an existing `FormGroup`,
 * and provides methods to retrieve the nested `FormGroup` and individual controls.

/**
 * @description
 * The `ControlValueAccessor` for writing select control values and listening to select control
 * changes. The value accessor is used by the `FormControlDirective`, `FormControlName`, and
 * `NgModel` directives.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Using select controls in a reactive form
 *
 * The following examples show how to use a select control in a reactive form.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Using select controls in a template-driven form
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Customizing option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const selectedCountriesControl = new FormControl();
 * ```
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [formControl]="selectedCountriesControl">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in IE, see:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event#browser_compatibility
 *
 * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule
 * @ngModule FormsModule

 *
 * ```ts

 *   </option>
 * </select>

 *
 * ### Customizing option selection
 *

 * See the `SelectControlValueAccessor` for usage.

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by sanitizing
 * values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink, `someValue` will be
 * sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a `javascript:` URL that would execute code on
 * the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for example if the
 * application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:` style link with a dynamic value in it.
 * Users can bypass security by constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...`
 * methods, and then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken to avoid creating a
 * Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early as possible and as
 * close as possible to the source of the value, to make it easy to verify no security bug is
 * created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value is safe, e.g. a URL that
 * does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous
 * code. The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.
 *
 * @security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in
 * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going
 * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.
 * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](https://g.co/ng/security).

/**
 * @description
 *
 * When applied to an element in a template, makes that element a link
 * that initiates navigation to a route. Navigation opens one or more routed components
 * in one or more `<router-outlet>` locations on the page.
 *
 * Given a route configuration `[{ path: 'user/:name', component: UserCmp }]`,
 * the following creates a static link to the route:
 * `<a routerLink="/user/bob">link to user component</a>`
 *
 * You can use dynamic values to generate the link.
 * For a dynamic link, pass an array of path segments,
 * followed by the params for each segment.
 * For example, `['/team', teamId, 'user', userName, {details: true}]`
 * generates a link to `/team/11/user/bob;details=true`.
 *
 * Multiple static segments can be merged into one term and combined with dynamic segements.
 * For example, `['/team/11/user', userName, {details: true}]`
 *
 * The input that you provide to the link is treated as a delta to the current URL.
 * For instance, suppose the current URL is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.
 * The link `<a [routerLink]="['/user/jim']">Jim</a>` creates the URL
 * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.
 * See {@link Router#createUrlTree createUrlTree} for more information.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * You can use absolute or relative paths in a link, set query parameters,
 * control how parameters are handled, and keep a history of navigation states.
 *
 * ### Relative link paths
 *
 * The first segment name can be prepended with `/`, `./`, or `../`.
 * * If the first segment begins with `/`, the router looks up the route from the root of the
 *   app.
 * * If the first segment begins with `./`, or doesn't begin with a slash, the router
 *   looks in the children of the current activated route.
 * * If the first segment begins with `../`, the router goes up one level in the route tree.
 *
 * ### Setting and handling query params and fragments
 *
 * The following link adds a query parameter and a fragment to the generated URL:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" fragment="education">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 * By default, the directive constructs the new URL using the given query parameters.
 * The example generates the link: `/user/bob?debug=true#education`.
 *
 * You can instruct the directive to handle query parameters differently
 * by specifying the `queryParamsHandling` option in the link.
 * Allowed values are:
 *
 *  - `'merge'`: Merge the given `queryParams` into the current query params.
 *  - `'preserve'`: Preserve the current query params.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [queryParams]="{debug: true}" queryParamsHandling="merge">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * See {@link UrlCreationOptions.queryParamsHandling UrlCreationOptions#queryParamsHandling}.
 *
 * ### Preserving navigation history
 *
 * You can provide a `state` value to be persisted to the browser's
 * [`History.state` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History#Properties).
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a [routerLink]="['/user/bob']" [state]="{tracingId: 123}">
 *   link to user component
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * Use {@link Router.getCurrentNavigation() Router#getCurrentNavigation} to retrieve a saved
 * navigation-state value. For example, to capture the `tracingId` during the `NavigationStart`
 * event:
 *
 * ```
 * // Get NavigationStart events
 * router.events.pipe(filter(e => e instanceof NavigationStart)).subscribe(e => {
 *   const navigation = router.getCurrentNavigation();
 *   tracingService.trace({id: navigation.extras.state.tracingId});
 * });
 * ```
 *

/**

 * @description
 *
 * Tracks whether the linked route of an element is currently active, and allows you
 * to specify one or more CSS classes to add to the element when the linked route
 * is active.
 *
 * Use this directive to create a visual distinction for elements associated with an active route.
 * For example, the following code highlights the word "Bob" when the router
 * activates the associated route:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * Whenever the URL is either '/user' or '/user/bob', the "active-link" class is
 * added to the anchor tag. If the URL changes, the class is removed.
 *
 * You can set more than one class using a space-separated string or an array.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="class1 class2">Bob</a>
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" [routerLinkActive]="['class1', 'class2']">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * To add the classes only when the URL matches the link exactly, add the option `exact: true`:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact:
 * true}">Bob</a>
 * ```
 *
 * To directly check the `isActive` status of the link, assign the `RouterLinkActive`
 * instance to a template variable.
 * For example, the following checks the status without assigning any CSS classes:
 *
 * ```
 * <a routerLink="/user/bob" routerLinkActive #rla="routerLinkActive">
 *   Bob {{ rla.isActive ? '(already open)' : ''}}
 * </a>
 * ```
 *
 * You can apply the `RouterLinkActive` directive to an ancestor of linked elements.
 * For example, the following sets the active-link class on the `<div>`  parent tag
 * when the URL is either '/user/jim' or '/user/bob'.
 *
 * ```
 * <div routerLinkActive="active-link" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}">
 *   <a routerLink="/user/jim">Jim</a>
 *   <a routerLink="/user/bob">Bob</a>
 * </div>

 * Acts as a placeholder that Angular dynamically fills based on the current router state.
 *
 * Each outlet can have a unique name, determined by the optional `name` attribute.
 * The name cannot be set or changed dynamically. If not set, default value is "primary".
 *
 * ```
 * <router-outlet></router-outlet>
 * <router-outlet name='left'></router-outlet>
 * <router-outlet name='right'></router-outlet>
 * ```
 *
 * Named outlets can be the targets of secondary routes.
 * The `Route` object for a secondary route has an `outlet` property to identify the target outlet:
 *
 * `{path: <base-path>, component: <component>, outlet: <target_outlet_name>}`
 *
 * Using named outlets and secondary routes, you can target multiple outlets in
 * the same `RouterLink` directive.
 *
 * The router keeps track of separate branches in a navigation tree for each named outlet and
 * generates a representation of that tree in the URL.
 * The URL for a secondary route uses the following syntax to specify both the primary and secondary
 * routes at the same time:
 *
 * `http://base-path/primary-route-path(outlet-name:route-path)`
 *
 * A router outlet emits an activate event when a new component is instantiated,
 * and a deactivate event when a component is destroyed.
 *
 * ```
 * <router-outlet
 *   (activate)='onActivate($event)'
 *   (deactivate)='onDeactivate($event)'></router-outlet>
 * ```
