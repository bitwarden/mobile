# Build/Run

**Requirements**

- [Visual Studio](https://store.xamarin.com/)

**API endpoint**

By default the app is targeting the production API. If you are running the [Core](https://github.com/bitwarden/core) API locally,
you'll need to switch the app to target your local instance. Open `src/App/Utilities/ApiHttpClient.cs` and `src/App/Utilities/IdentityHttpClient.cs` and set the `BaseAddress` to your local
API endpoints (ex. `new Uri("http://localhost:5000")`). Alternatively, you can also adjust the environment endpoints from the environment settings page on the home screen of the app (log out).

**Run the app**

After restoring the nuget packages, you can now build and run the app.
